# Building Foundation Area Calculator

This Python program calculates the area of a building's foundation based on the chosen shape: square, rectangular, or round.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the shape of the building as follows:
   - 's' for square
   - 'r' for rectangular
   - 'ro' for round

3. Follow the on-screen prompts based on your shape selection:

   - For a **square**, provide the length of one side.
   - For a **rectangular**, provide the length and width.
   - For a **round**, provide the radius.

4. The program will calculate and display the area of the building's foundation.

## Formulas Used

- For a **square**, the area is calculated as the square of the length of one side: `Area = side_length^2`.

- For a **rectangular**, the area is calculated as the product of the length and width: `Area = length * width`.

- For a **round**, the area is calculated using the mathematical constant π (pi): `Area = π * radius^2`.
